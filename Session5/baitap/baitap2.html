                <p><strong>Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Known for her
                        autobiographical
                        songwriting, artistic reinventions, and cultural impact, Swift is a leading figure in popular
                        music
                        and the subject of
                        widespread media coverage, with a vast fanbase known as 'Swifties.' </strong></p>
                <p><strong>
                        Swift signed to Big Machine Records in 2005, debuting as a country singer with the albums Taylor
                        Swift (2006) and
                        Fearless (2008). The singles "Teardrops on My Guitar," "Love Story," and "You Belong with Me"
                        found
                        crossover success on
                        country and pop radio formats. She incorporated rock on Speak Now (2010) and electronic on Red
                        (2012), later
                        re-categorizing her image from country to pop with the synth-pop set 1989 (2014); the ensuing
                        media
                        scrutiny inspired
                        the hip-hop-blued Reputation (2017). The albums contained the Billboard Hot 100 number-one
                        singles
                        "We Are Never Ever
                        Getting Back Together," "Shake It Off," "Blank Space," "Bad Blood," and "Look What You Made Me
                        Do."
